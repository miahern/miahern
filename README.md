## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a Senior in the BA Information Studies program with School of Library and Information Studes at OU. I gradute this upcoming Spring semester and currently work at the LAW Library in the College of Law at OU. Some fun facts about me: I have traveled to Italy 3 times with OU, I am trying to speak Italian and then someday Spanish, I am from San Antonio, TX, and I have always wanted to be a librarian since watching The Mummy (1998). My favorite movies are Jurassic Park (all three films) and The Mummy (all three,yes, yes even the one with Michelle Yoh and Jet Li), and Crimson Peak. I love playing video games, I play Genshin Impact, I am an OG player from when they first launched the game, My Adventure Rank is 57.
